# ECE student resume template
This is a basic LaTeX template for resumes.  Just edit the sections you want.  Please feel free to comment out the sections you don't need.

You can build this from command line using the included ```Makefile```.  To compile in a bash shell use:

```
$ make
```
Alternatively, you can compress this to a ```.zip``` and upload to Overleaf for easier editing and compilation.

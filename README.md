# ECE student resume template
This is a basic LaTeX template for resumes.  Just edit the sections you want.  Comment out the sections you don't need.

You can build this from commandline using the included ```Makefile```.  To compile in a bash shell just use:

```
$ make
```
Alternatively you can compress this to a ```.zip``` and upload to Overleaf for easier editing and compilation.
